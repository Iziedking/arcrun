/// wagmi config, built through RainbowKit's `getDefaultConfig` so the wallet
/// picker is populated with the full branded list (MetaMask, Rabby, Coinbase,
/// Rainbow, WalletConnect + the mobile QR path), not just whichever EIP-6963
/// extension happens to be installed. A plain `injected()` connector produced a
/// one-row modal; this is the rich picker.
///
/// getDefaultConfig is client-only, so this module must NOT be imported into a
/// server component (e.g. for cookieToInitialState) — it throws there. With
/// ssr:true it persists the connection in cookieStorage, so a returning user
/// reconnects from cookies on the client. The session detector in useAuth waits
/// for that reconnect (the walletSettled gate) before judging the wallet
/// missing, which is what keeps a full-page navigation from signing the user
/// out mid-reconnect.
///
/// WalletConnect needs a project id from cloud.reown.com
/// (NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID). When it is absent, expose only the
/// injected browser-wallet connector. This keeps email and extension-wallet
/// sign-in usable without sending broken placeholder requests to Reown.
///
/// BNB Testnet is Agon's default context while the product is being built.
/// BNB Mainnet and Arc Testnet are also registered so the network selector can
/// move a wallet to the exact context represented by the URL. Legacy ArcRun
/// routes continue to use Arc Testnet.
///
/// The Arc transport is the hot path (every wallet read — balances, contract
/// reads — goes through it), and the public Arc RPC rate-limits bursts. So it gets
/// JSON-RPC batching (coalesce concurrent reads into one request), a retry for the
/// 429/5xx, and dedicated endpoint(s) via NEXT_PUBLIC_ARC_RPC_HTTP (comma-separated,
/// primary first). When set, the transport is a `fallback([...])` that tries the
/// dedicated endpoint(s) then the public RPC, so one endpoint failing never breaks
/// wallet reads. The bridge source chains stay on their bare public RPCs — they're
/// touched only during an occasional bridge, not on every page.
